make an array for each user in the database called notifications. 

when you follow a user it searches the database for that users username and then stores 
an object with the notification data like {
    id: 
    userid: user who the notification is for
    triggerUser: can be null if no user caused the notification 
    type: like or follow or comment
    message: a text description of the notification
    timestamp: when the notification happened.
}
