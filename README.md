Pictogram
Pictogram is a broken and unfinished clone of Twitter/Instagram. This project serves as a perfect example of spaghetti code and overambitiousness.

Technologies Used:

Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime
JavaScript: Main programming language
HTML/CSS: Markup and styling
EJS: Templating engine for rendering views
Lowdb: Simple JSON database for local storage
NeDB: Lightweight NoSQL database for persistence
Feel free to dissect and mutilate the code for your own goals!
